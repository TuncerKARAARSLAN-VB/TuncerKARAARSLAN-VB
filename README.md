# Development of the Warehouse Management System

**Company:** Farma Lojistik  
**Type:** Contract  
**Duration:** Jan 2011 - Jul 2011 (7 months)  
**Position:** Consultant  
**Location:** Office-based

Managing the processes from collecting incoming work orders from a 25,000 m¬≤ warehouse in SAP, transferring products collected with pallets to collection points, palletizing, loading, and delivering them to customers. In this project, collection times were minimized, and with the developed handheld terminal software, the warehouse, where 8.5 million boxes are moved monthly, was managed by a total of 21 people, including the general manager.

The most important feature of the project is that it includes the concept of 'mudi.' The system ensures that products with the nearest expiration date are collected first, but since the products on the shelf containing medicines belong to different companies, only the products nearing expiration from the specific company are collected. This feature does not normally exist in warehouse and packaging management systems, so the product was redeveloped to work fully integrated with SAP.

*Oca 2004 - Kas 2005 ¬∑ 1 yƒ±l 11 ay*  
**Role:** Yazƒ±lƒ±m Mimarƒ±, Takƒ±m Lideri

In 2005, I played an important role in the digitization project of a province's Geographic Information System (GIS) data and actively contributed to the development of the automation system designed to manage the processes of the municipality's water, environment, accounting and collection units. As a team leader and software architect, I ensured the maintenance and management of Oracle databases, web application development approaches with C#, and the transfer of old data to the new system. In this process, I aimed for data security and fast transfer.

The automation system developed enabled the services provided to be visualized on the map. In this way, the distribution of investments was tracked and solution strategies were developed by monitoring the intensity of problems and notifications received from citizens. Monitoring pending problems on giant screens on the map contributed to the transparency of operational processes.

Automation allowed the mayor, who manages the city, to monitor the tasks of his teams in the field. Garbage collection operations were updated according to traffic density, and teams in the field were directed via tablets. This flexibility increased the efficiency of garbage collection processes and enabled better planning.

Water and environment units managed collection processes more effectively, while the accounting unit made financial transactions more transparent. This facilitated citizens' access to water and environmental services.

I followed the progress of the project through regular meetings and was involved in problem-solving processes. This approach kept team members focused on the goals and increased their motivation.

As a result, the automation system developed has increased the municipality's operational efficiency and improved service quality. This process, which provided significant benefits for both employees and citizens, was a valuable experience for my professional development.

Notably, leveraging data from IBM Maximo and integrating it with other field management systems resulted in the sales department achieving sales of up to $2 billion within just two years in the early 2000s. The integration with SQL Server enhanced data analysis and reporting, significantly contributing to strategic decision-making processes.

Additionally, I developed innovative software to support sales and marketing processes. These applications facilitated market analysis, campaign management, and the collection of customer feedback, helping sales teams enhance their performance. With robust data analysis and reporting capabilities, I supported strategic decision-making processes, enabling businesses to gain a competitive edge. The innovative software solutions I developed served as a benchmark in the industry and underscored the importance of a customer-centric approach.
